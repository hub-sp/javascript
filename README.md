## Primitives

There are 6 primitives as of Node.js v12.6.0
* `null`
* `undefined`
* `string`
* `number`
* `bigint`

### Null
`null`, essentially, is nothing. It is used when you want to convey that there is no data at that location.

### Undefined
`undefined` is the type you get when you initialize a variable with no value.
```js
let thing;
```
